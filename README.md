# Mario Math
This is my first game, it was made with raw Java libraries such as JFrame and without a game Engine(Bad Idea).

The inspiration behind the game was to teach my friends brother what coding can do. The game also taught him some
math while he played which was good to hear.

To play:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Simply run the jar file
